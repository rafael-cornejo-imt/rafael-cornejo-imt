# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a student with a strong interest in the design, programming, and control of mechanical and electronic systems. I have gained experience through various robotics, digital design, and smart manufacturing projects. Familiar with tools like SolidWorks, Arduino, and PLCs. I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies. ðŸš€.
